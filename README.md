# Aegis Browser

### Vision
My vision for Aegis Browser is to create the world's most secure and versatile browser, seamlessly integrating Web2, Web3, and Onion network functionalities. The goal is to provide a single, powerful tool for all browsing needs, prioritizing user security, privacy, and control.

### Features
**Web2 Browsing (Current Functionality):**
* **Tabbed Interface:** Manage multiple web pages easily.
* **Standard Navigation:** Back, forward, reload, and home buttons for a familiar experience.
* **URL Bar:** Navigate to any website.
* **Dynamic Tab Titles:** Tab names update with the page title.

**Web3 Integration (Planned):**
* **Integrated Crypto Wallet:** A built-in wallet to manage and interact with cryptocurrencies and NFTs without needing extensions.
* **Decentralized Application (dApp) Access:** Direct connection to blockchain networks to use dApps for DeFi, gaming, and more.
* **Enhanced Privacy:** By using blockchain, Aegis Browser will give users true ownership of their data and prevent centralized platforms from tracking and selling it.

**Onion Network Functionality (Planned):**
* **Anonymity:** Route traffic through the Tor network to hide your IP address and online activity from surveillance and tracking.
* **Anti-Fingerprinting:** Make all users look the same to resist techniques that identify you based on your browser and device information.
* **Censorship Circumvention:** Access blocked websites and content in a secure way.
* **Secure Browsing:** Multi-layered encryption for your traffic as it passes through the Tor network.

### Current Development
Aegis Browser is a personal project still in its early stages. The current version provides a basic Web2 browsing experience. I'm actively working on adding the advanced features mentioned above. The project's development will be focused on a modular architecture to ensure each browsing mode (Web2, Web3, Onion) is secure and stable.

### Contribution
This is a work in progress, and your contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, suggest improvements, and help build a browser that puts the user in control of their online experience.

### Note
This project may contain bugs and is a prototype. Do not use it as your primary browser for critical tasks until it has undergone further development and security audits.
